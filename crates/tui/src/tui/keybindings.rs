//! Documentation-only catalog of every user-facing keybinding.
//!
//! This module is the *single source of truth* for what shortcuts the help
//! overlay renders. The actual key handlers live in `tui/ui.rs` (and a few
//! sibling modules); they read keys directly off the crossterm event stream
//! and intentionally do **not** consult this catalog. The catalog exists so
//! that:
//!
//! 1. The help overlay (`tui/views/help.rs`) does not have to maintain a
//!    parallel list that silently rots when a handler is added or moved.
//! 2. New contributors have one place to look when answering "which keys are
//!    bound, and where do they go?"
//!
//! When you add or change a binding in `ui.rs`, **add or update the matching
//! entry here**. The compile-only side-effect of forgetting is a stale help
//! screen; there is no runtime crash, so the discipline lives in code review.
//!
//! Entries are grouped by `KeybindingSection`. The `chord` field is a
//! human-readable string formatted exactly the way it should appear in help —
//! we avoid storing `KeyBinding` values directly because many shortcuts are
//! pairs (`↑/↓`) or families (`Alt+1/2/3`) that don't map cleanly to a single
//! chord.
